# Python with librdkafka

[librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka) is a C/C++ library for [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org). This image extends the [python official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/) by building and installing librdkafka. This is useful for Python modules that use librdkafka to communicate with Kafka.
